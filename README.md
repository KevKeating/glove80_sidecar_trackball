# Glove80 Sidecar Trackball
A 3D printed trackball designed to fit into the sidecar module of the [MoErgo Glove80 keyboard](https://www.moergo.com/).  The trackball uses the internals of a [Logitech Ergo M575](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/m575-ergo-wireless-trackball.html) and can fit any size trackball from 34 mm (which is what the M575 uses) up to 55 mm.  This project is still a bit of a work-in-progress and I'm planning to continue refining the design, but the trackball is fully usable in its current state.  (Also, I'm not affiliated with MoErgo or Logitech in any way.)

I printed most of the parts in PLA, so that's what the tolerances are set for.  For the foot, I used TPU (to give the bottom few layers some grip) and PETG (for the rest of the foot), but PLA will work fine there.  PLA+ would work fine for all of the parts as well.  If you want something that's more temperature resistant, you could probably get everything working with PETG, but you'd likely need to tweak the mouse buttons to make them a bit more rigid so that they don't bend before they depress the switch.  Note that assembling the trackball will require a bit of soldering to attach new battery terminals.  You'll also need to remove the existing battery terminals, but that can be accomplished with some tin snips or something similar if you don't want to worry about desoldering.

TODO: move these to a separate Additional images document?

### Required materials

- all printed parts
- Logitech Ergo M575 trackball
- a larger trackball (optional - you can use the 34 mm ball from the M575 if you want)
- 20x M2.5x8mm screws, button head
- 1x M4 x 40mm threaded rod
- 1x M4 heat set threaded insert, 6 mm OD, 8 mm length
- 3x 2.5mm bearing balls (I used zirconium oxide G5 balls)
- AA battery contact plates, 13.5 mm x 11.5 mm
- electrical wire, about 5" - 7" / 20 - 30 cm each of red and black 22 AWG hook up wire
- solder
- 2x flat cables, 10 pins 0.5 mm pitch, 150 mm length, A type ([these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RWTFSG7) are what I used)

### Required tools

- soldering iroff
- small Philips head (#1) screw driver for the screws holding the trackball together
- small screw driver for the M2.5 screws (if they're hex head, you'll need a 1.5 mm hex wrench)
- prying and spudging tools to disassemble the trackball (e.g. [these](https://www.ifixit.com/products/prying-and-opening-tool-assortment))

One or more of
- desoldering wick
- a solder sucker
- tin snips
- wire cutter
(You'll need these to remove the existing battery terminal wires from the M575's PCB.)
